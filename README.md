# Singularity


These set of tools that are meant to help in the creation of a game or game engine for programming languages that don't a have stable or existing binding for Vulkan. This repo will only help in the creation of Applications and provide an abstraction over graphics and physics api.

***Note***: Physics api abstraction will be in a seperate repo.

# TODO
- ~~Finish D3D11 abstraction~~ (***Focusing on vulkan instead***)
- [ ] Create Vulkan abstraction
- [ ] Support other platform like linux
